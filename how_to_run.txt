Hi Dr.Sanchez, 

I'm Peter Ho
This is the manual for my code. 

Step 1: To run it, just go to Control and run. 
Step 2: Type rows/columns for First and Second Matrix
Step 3: Click create --> it will show up 2 windows for X and Y Matrix
Step 4: Type numbers that want to calculate for X and Y Matrix 
*-Step 5-*: Click "Read" for both 2 Matrix
Step 6: Then choose "Addition", "Subtraction", or "Multiplication" from the ComboBox to execute
Step 7: You can save a file in any window have "Save" button (just type the name of file in the TextField
and click save, MUST Read before)
Step 8: You can open a file in any window have "Open" button (type the name of file in the TextField and click
Open, MUST Read before)

Note: some buttons are temporarily not working such as reset, quit, clear. 

Thank you for your time reading these lines. 

Have a great day, Dr.Sanchez!
